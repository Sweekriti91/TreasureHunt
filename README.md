On App Launch, click the "Start here" Button. 

On Android -> Move the device around (as the gif suggests) and hit the locate button -> enter the ID for the Anchor you are close to, move the device around that area and wait for the status to say, "Anchor Located!"

On iOS -> Enter the ID for the Anchor you are close to, move the device around that area and wait for the status to say, "Anchor Located!"


Known Issues :
- Crash when trying to locate multiple anchors within same session -> current fix: hit back and click the "Start Here" Button again
- Anchor takes a while to be located -> try walking around the area, moving the device around and it will be located. I promise. 

Code coming soon!
